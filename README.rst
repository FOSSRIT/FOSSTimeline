FOSS@RIT Simile Widgets
=======================

This repo contains the html, json, css, and javascript used for creating an
Interactive Storytelling Exhibit for The FOSS@RIT Campaign. It is based on the
MIT Simile Project Exhibit example:
http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/examples/nobelists/nobelists.html

These widgets will be publicly available at http://foss.rit.edu/edu.

The Simile Timeline widget inspired us to give Exhibit a try, and it does not
dissapoint. Shout out to the MIT Media Lab http://media.mit.edu for releasing
the source under a permissive license such as BSD, and writing such useful
tools.

Feeding the Simile Widgets
==========================

Really, there is one file that feeds the whole system: contributors.js. This
file is the json that powers the timeline and the exhibit.
